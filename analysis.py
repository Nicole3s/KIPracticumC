# Set the given parameters to obtain the specified policies through

#  voor parallel exercise
# For exercise 4
# discount parameters analysis for
#  0.5 -> attempted to cross the bridge by only going to the first square and going back to the start terminal state (west) and ended with reward 1.
# It took action west
# 0.25 -> The same at 0.5
# 0.75 -> the same at 0.5
#  1 -> attempted to cross the bridge by only going to the first square (east) but exit the bridge by going south
# 0.1 -> the same at 0.5
# noise parameters analysis for
# 0.1 -> the same at 0.5 discount
# 0.01 -> It crosses the bridge by going east till he reaches the end state
# 0.005 -> It crosses the bridge by going east till he reaches the end state
# 0.001 -> It crosses the bridge by going east till he reaches the end state
# 0 -> It crosses the bridge by going east till he reaches the end state
# 0.02 -> The same at 0.1
